# kanye-west-app

This is a project that uses a free api I found online called [kanye.rest](kanye.rest) that returns a random quote that Kanye West has said or tweeted in the past. I'm using this project to learn more about using REST APIs and tp continue improving my web developments skills.

## Possible Features
- Drop-down that switches between a list of famous people, which will change the picture and the quote on the screen to the new person selected
- Attempt to make an api to call that resembles the kanye.rest api or find a way to emulate what the api does for different celebrities
- In general, the page could look a lot better with some more time spent styling
